Our research tries to answer questions about the evolution of proteins and how this information can be used to create a new range of AI tools.
\
The tools we have developed make it possible to predict the structure of interacting proteins, and to design new molecules that bind to proteins.
\
We aim to create a universal molecular framework, where any molecule can be predicted. With this technology, the design of new molecules will be possible at the click of a button â€“ for any application.
\
We are deploying the technology we develop and **test it in the lab** - to create new molecular functions.
